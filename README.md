# clubready_booker

## Overview

Book yourself into classes automatically with gyms that use ClubReady to manage
their class schedule.

This is a bit against the spirit of the system, so in order to be as minimal of 
a nuisance as possible, but still get a spot in all the classes you want, there 
is Google Calendar integration. If there is an event on your default Google 
Calendar with the same name and start time as a class, `clubready_booker` will 
book you into that class.
